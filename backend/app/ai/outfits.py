Weather today: {weather}

Garments (JSON): {garments}

Rules:
- Every outfit needs shoes, plus either one top and one bottom, or one one_piece. Never both.
- {outerwear_rule}
- An accessory is optional, at most one.
- Use each garment only in the slot of its own category and refer to it by its "ref".
- Prefer combinations whose colors and formality work well together.
- The outfits must differ from each other in their top, bottom or one_piece.
- Do not repeat any of these combinations already shown today: {seen}
- If fewer than {count} good outfits are possible, return fewer.
- "explanation": one short sentence, at most 20 words, in neutral Latin American Spanish, \
addressing the person as "tú", saying why the outfit works today. Talk about the outfit, never \
describe the person: no adjectives or participles about them such as "cómodo", "protegida" or \
"abrigado"; use verbs instead ("te protege de la lluvia", "te mantiene a gusto"). No emojis, no \
garment refs. Mention only garments that are in that outfit."""
